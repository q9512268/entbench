<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rpm-intro"></a>1.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The XForms Reference Processing Model is a normative explanation of the components, 
  predictive behavior, and mechanisms of XForms Processors. It is not intended to
  constrain implementations. XForms Processors may be implemented in any manner, so
  long as the end results are identical to that described in this chapter.</p>
  
<p>This chapter uses the terms <b>may</b>, <b>must</b>, and 
  <b>should</b> (when rendered as in this paragraph) in 
  accord with RFC 2119.</p>
  
<div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="issue-processing"></a><b>Issue (issue-processing):</b></p>
<p>This chapter is still at an early phase and may contain errors or omissions.
Feedback on this chapter is especially appreciated.</p></div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-intro-rationale"></a>1.1.1 Design Rationale</h4>

<p>The Reference Processing Model set out in this chapter will:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Be simple enough to implement across a wide range of devices, including 
    resource-constrained handhelds and appliances.</p></li>
  <li><p>Define a predictive processing model with enough detail for implementors 
    to create interoperable software.</p></li>
  <li><p>Define a well-ordered system for calculations and dependencies independent 
    of processor speed or threading.</p></li>
  <li><p>Provide a unified addressing scheme for binding expressions, independent 
    of how the structure of the instance data is defined.</p></li>
  <li><p>Be simple enough for the existing base of HTML authors to quickly get up 
    to speed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Be compatible (to the extent reasonably possible) with existing form processing.</p></li>
  
</ul>
</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rpm-properties"></a>1.2 XForms Properties</h3>

<p>For each <code>xform</code> element, the XForms Processor maintains 
  a set of read-write properties, as described here. These properties are available to all
  expressions in the <a title="" href="#">containing document</a>.</p>
<ul>
  
  
  
  
  <li><p><code>immediate-refresh</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>immediate-revalidate</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>immediate-recalculate</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>use-nil</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>immediate-refresh</code>  controls whether changes in the 
  instance data are immediately updated in the UI</p>
<p><code>immediate-revalidate</code>  controls whether changes in 
  the instance data immediately trigger a validation</p>
<p><code>immedate-recalculate</code> controls whether changes in 
  the instance data immediately trigger a recalculation</p>
<p><code>use-nil</code> controls whether XML Schema Instance nils 
  are placed in the instance data</p><p>Additionally, the following properties are available for reading (but not modification). These properties are available to all expressions in the containing document.</p><ul>
  <li><p><code>version</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>conformance-level</code></p></li>
  
  <li><p><code>timezone</code></p></li>
  
  
  
  
</ul><p><code>version</code>  is defined as the string "1.0" for 
  XForms 1.0</p>
<p><code>conformance-level</code> strings are defined later in this chapter</p>

<p><code>timezone</code>  strings are signed integers representing the 
  number of minutes offset from GMT</p>


</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rpm-events"></a>1.3 Events</h3>
<p>XForms uses an events system as defined in <a href="#">[ref-dom2-events]</a>,
with a Capture phase, arrival at the Event Target, and then a Bubbling Phase.</p>

<p>Events fall into different groupings. One class of events indicates that some 
  processing is about to happen. That processing may be halted by the event handler:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><code>xforms-submit</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-reset</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-value-changing</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-interactive-value-changing</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-instance-changed</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another class of events indicates that some processing has already happened 
  or is in progress. Such processing can not be halted by the event hander:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><code>xforms-construct</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-destruct</code></p></li>
  
  <li><p><code>xforms-initialize</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-exception</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, certain events are used by the author or the XForms Processor to cause 
  processing to happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><code>xforms-recalculate</code></p></li>
  <li><p><code>xforms-refresh</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, the target node for all events is the <code>xform</code> 
  element. When a containing document has multiple <code>xform</code> 
  elements, the binding is used to determine which <code>xform</code> 
  element is used.</p>
  
<p>The Working Group is using pre-defined generic event handling, defined in <a href="#">[ref-xhtml-events]</a>, additionally defining a set of XForms-specific actions.</p>
</div>



<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rpm-processing"></a>1.4 XForms Processing</h3>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-init"></a>1.4.1 Initialization/Resume</h4>

<p>The following describes the initialization process for XForms. Initialization 
  must occur before any other processing. For each <code>xform</code> 
  element in the containing document, in document order, the following processing 
  occurs:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> An <code>xforms-construct</code> event is fired; this is the place for 
    authors to handle any initialization tasks.</p></li><li><p>Instance data is constructed (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>).</p></li>
  
  <li><p>An <code>xforms-initialize</code> event is fired. A handler for this event could perform form initialization tasks such as a database lookup.</p></li>
  <li><p>A recalculation (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) takes place.</p></li>
  <li><p>A UI refresh (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) takes place.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-instance"></a>1.4.2 Instance Data Construction</h4><p>The following steps describe how the instance data associated with each <code>xform</code> element is constructed. Of the following options, the first applicable option is chosen. Only one of the following applies:</p><ol>
  <li><p>If an <code>instance</code> element is present and contains non-whitespace child nodes, the contents of the <code>instance</code> element are copied into the instance data tree, based on the infoset mappings defined in the XPath <a href="#">[ref-xpath-1.0]</a>data model.</p></li><li><p>If an <code>instance</code> element is present and contains a reference to non-local 
    initial instance data, it is retrieved by traversing the link to it, then copied into the instance data as described above.  A remote instance that
    is unretrievable for any reason is ignored, in which case an 
    XForms Processor <b>may</b> issue a warning.</p></li>
  <li><p>If  an <code>instance</code> element is not present, then a default instance data configuration is produced, according to the following rules:
  </p><ol>
      <li><p>Each form control bound to the 
        <code>xform</code> element currently being processed is visited 
        in document order. Each form control's binding expression is 
        evaluated.</p></li>
      <li><p>If the instance data item 
        result of evaluating the binding expression doesn't already exist, it is 
        created, and if the <code>use-nil</code> 
        property is true, populated with a nil value (an <code>xsi:nil="true"</code> attribute). Note that  only 
        elements can hold nil values. The form control receives a default
        blank value. The algorithm for creating instance data items is 
        as follows: For each location step in the canonical binding expression,
        from left to right, where no matching node exists in the
        instance data, a new node is inserted.</p><div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="creating-instance-nodes"></a><b>Issue (creating-instance-nodes):</b></p><p>The algorithm for creating instance nodes is under discussion, with one possibility being ignoring the path information, using only the local name, in a flat list.</p></div></li>
  </ol></li><li><p>If none of the above options are fulfilled, this is an error condition, and the XForms Processor <b>must</b> stop processing with an error message.</p></li></ol></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-navorder"></a>1.4.3 Navigation Sequence Algorithm</h4>

<p> Navigation is determined on a containing document-wide basis. The navigation sequence 
  is determined as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> Those form controls that support <code>navindex</code> and assign a positive 
    value to it are navigated first. Navigation proceeds from the form control 
    with the lowest <code>navindex</code> value to the form control with the highest 
    value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular 
    value. form controls that have identical 
    <code>navindex</code> values should be navigated in document order.</p></li>
  <li><p> Those form controls that do not supply <code>navindex</code> or supply 
    a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document 
    order.</p></li>
  <li><p>Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or on a non <code>relevant</code> 
    subtree are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate 
    as navigable controls.</p></li>
  <li><p> The navigation sequence past the the last form control (or before the first) 
    is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, 
    remove focus from the form, or other possibilities.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-interact"></a>1.4.4 Interactivity</h4>

<p>XForms provides similar processing to the HTML <code>onChange</code> event. 
  As users indicate completion of a form control by navigating away the following 
  occurs:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> If the display value has changed since the user last navigated to the form 
    control, an <code>xforms-value-changing</code> event is fired. If the 
    display value hasn't changed, processing for this event ends.
  </p><ol>
      <li><p>Any listener may prevent default processing (one option under consideration 
        provides a <code>&lt;stopevent/&gt;</code> action), which will end event 
        processing immediately after the Capture and Bubbling phases. Alternatively, 
        a listener may perform a custom translation from display value to canonical 
        value. Any listener may have side-effects that modify any instance data item,
        in which case the modified instance data items must be marked "dirty".</p></li>
    <li><p>Default processing is to convert the display value of the form control 
      to the canonical value as specified in the Datatypes chapter. Default processing 
      should automatically take into account regional settings (if any), such 
      as decimal character symbol, date formats, etc.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>If the <code>immediate-revalidate</code> property is true, all validations
    (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) bound to the form control are run. Note that validation is performed against 
    the canonical value, not the display value.
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>If any validation fails, the user <b>must</b> be notified, and 
      <b>may</b> not be allowed to navigate away from the control. The 
      invalid entry in the form control <b>should</b> be preserved. 
      The associated instance data item is left unchanged, thereby ending processing 
      for this event.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>The instance data item is updated with the new value, and marked "dirty".</p></li>
  <li><p> If the <code>immediate-recalculate</code> property is true, a recalculate
  (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) occurs to perform any defined calculations.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the <code>immediate-refresh</code> property is true, a refresh (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) 
    occurs to update any form controls that might be dependent on this newly changed 
    value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Certain form controls allow interactive response without finalizing on a value. 
  Examples of this include edit boxes (users can type various characters before 
  "tabbing out") and slider controls (users can be continuously adjusting 
  the value before releasing at a certain value). Interactive temporary values 
  such as this are expressly allowed to be "invalid", that is outside 
  the permissible value space. This is because incomplete data may be present 
  while the user is entering transitional values.</p>
<p>Example: A partially entered currency value of "U" is not valid because 
  it doesn't (yet) have 3 characters. This is permitted temporarily, as long as 
  the user remains on the form control. XForms Processors with sufficient processing 
  resources would typically update/refresh on every character. Resource-constrained 
  XForms Processors would typically only update/refresh on the final value.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> Any time the display value of a form control changes (such as through character 
    or cut/paste activities), even without indication that this is a final value, 
    an <code>xforms-interactive-value-changing</code> event is fired. Resource-constrained 
    XForms Processor implementations <b>may</b> choose to ignore all 
    such events.
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>Event listeners may prevent default processing.</p></li>
    <li><p>Otherwise, default handling is as follows: The current form control is 
      revalidated (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>). This is for internal purposes only, 
      and happens regardless of the <code>immediate-revalidate</code> setting. 
      If all validations on the form control are successful, the instance data item
      is updated, and marked "dirty". If any validations fail (indicating 
      a transitional value) all form controls bound to the same instance data item
      <b>may</b> be directly updated with the display value. Otherwise, 
      the following occurs:</p></li>
    <li><p>If the <code>immediate-recalculate</code> property is true, a recalculation
      (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) occurs to perform any defined calculations.</p></li>
    <li><p>If the <code>immediate-refresh</code> property is true, a refresh (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) 
      occurs to update any form controls that might be dependent on this newly 
      changed value.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Implementations that choose to respond <code>xforms-interactive-value-changing</code> 
  are expected optimize processing (for instance not flashing the entire screen 
  for each character entered, etc.).</p>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-recalc"></a>1.4.5 Recalculation Algorithm</h4>

<p>XForms Processors are free (and encouraged) to skip or change any steps in 
  this algorithm, as long as the end result is the same. Each form control may 
  have a model item property <code>priority</code> value, which is the main factor 
  in determining calculation order.</p>
<p>Following is the default handling for an <code>xforms-recalculate</code> event:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Each model item with a bound <code>calculate</code> model item property
  is visited in <b>calculation order</b>, which is defined as follows:
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>Those model items that are bound to a <code>priority</code> and assign 
      a positive integer to it are computed first. Computation proceeds from the 
      model item with the lowest bound <code>priority</code> to the model item 
      with the highest bound <code>priority</code>. Values need not be sequential 
      nor must they begin with any particular value. Model items with the same bound
      <code>priority</code> value are computed in document order.</p></li>
    <li><p>Those model items not bound to a priority or bound to one with the value 
      "0" are computed next. These model items are computed in document 
      order.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>For each model item, the expression in the <code>calculate</code> model item 
  property is evaluated. Any instance data item changes as a result of 
    this are marked with a "dirty" flag.</p></li>
  <li><p>The instance data item bound to the model item is updated with the result 
    of the <code>calculate</code> expression, and the "dirty" flag is set.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-refresh"></a>1.4.6 UI Refresh Algorithm</h4>
<p>Following is the default handling for an <code>xforms-refresh</code> event:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> For purposes of UI refresh, the instance data as it exists at the 
    beginning of processing the <code>xforms-refresh</code> event is used.</p></li>
  <li><p> Each form control is visited in refresh order, which is defined as follows:
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>Those form controls that have a given or computed navigation sequence 
      value are visited first, in the navigation sequence.</p></li>
    <li><p>Those form controls outside the navigation sequence are visited next. 
      These form controls are visited in document order.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>For each form control, the <code>relevant</code> constraint is evaluated, 
    which might result in the form control being disabled/hidden/etc. as specified 
    in the chapter <a href="#"><b>???</b></a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>For each form control, the binding expression is evaluated. If the
  instance data indicates that the instance data item is not "dirty", processing for
  that particular form control completes.
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>Otherwise, if the instance data item is "dirty", an <code>xforms-instance-changed</code> 
      event is fired.</p></li>
    <li><p>Listeners to the <code>xforms-instance-changed</code> event are free to 
      compute a new display value.</p></li>
    <li><p>Listeners to the <code>xforms-instance-changed</code> event are prohibited 
      from directly updating any form controls present.</p></li>
    <li><p>Listeners to the <code>xforms-instance-changed</code> event are prohibited 
      from altering any portion of the instance data. To attempt to do so 
      results in an <code>xforms-exception</code> being fired.</p></li>
    <li><p>Listeners may prevent the default processing of the <code>xforms-instance-changed</code> 
      event.</p></li>
    <li><p>Default processing is to convert the canonical value into a display value, 
      taking into account regional settings (if any) such as decimal separator 
      character, etc.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>The form control is updated with the display value.</p></li>
  <li><p>After all form controls have been updated, all "dirty" flags in 
    the instance data are cleared.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="note"><p class="prefix"><b>Note:</b></p><p>Editor's Note: Still to be addressed is the processing when a datatype facet 
  or model item property are changed--what gets marked "dirty"?; what 
  gets recalculated?; what gets revalidated?; what gets refreshed?</p></div>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-processing-revalidate"></a>1.4.7 Revalidation Algorithm</h4>

<p>Revalildation always occurs within the scope of a context form control.
Following is the revalidation process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p> The bound instance data item is checked against any bound XForms Datatype 
    constraining facets. If any fail, the context form control is considered invalid.</p></li>
  <li><p> The bound instance data item is checked against any bound Schema Datatype 
    constraining facets. If any fail, the context form control is considered invalid.</p></li>
  <li><p> If a <code>validate</code> model item property is bound to the context 
    form control, the expression within is evaluated. If it evaluates to false, 
    the context form control is considered invalid.</p></li>
  <li><p> If the context form control is invalid, the XForms Processor <b>must</b> 
    notify the user. The XForms Processor <b>may</b> combine messages 
    before presentation to the user.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3><a name="rpm-send"></a>1.5 Submit and Reset</h3>

<p>The form filling experience ends with submitting the form, 
  or starting over. The XForms processing for these events are covered here. The following sections describe how to instance data is prepared for submission.</p>


<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-send-submit"></a>1.5.1 Submit</h4>

<p>In response to an <code>xforms-submit</code> event, the following takes place:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Event listeners may prevent default processing of the submit request. Otherwise, 
    default handling as described below occurs.</p></li>
  <li><p>Every form control is revalidated (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>). Any invalid 
    values <b>must</b> be reported to the user and submit processing 
    <b>must</b> not continue.</p></li>
  <li><p>A subset or all of the instance data is selected based on
  the binding expression used to invoke the submit request. The selected nodes and all children are selected for serialization as submitted data.
  If no <code>ref</code> attribute is specified, all nodes in the instance data are selected by default. </p><ol>
    <li><p>If the instance data selection results in an empty node-set, the submit 
      <b>must</b> be aborted and submit processing <b>must</b> 
      not continue.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>Instance data is serialized according to one of the processes defined below.</p></li>
  <li><p>Instance data is delivered over the network as an HTTP POST.</p></li><li><p>Upon successful delivery of the submit data, an <code>xforms-destruct</code> event is fired and form processing shuts down.</p></li><li><p>The response page sent by the server replaces the current containing document.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="method-strings"></a><b>Issue (method-strings):</b></p><p>We have yet to define the method strings (e.g. <code>method="post"</code> in XHTML)</p></div></div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-send-reset"></a>1.5.2 Reset</h4>
<p>In response to an <code>xforms-reset</code> event, the following takes place:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Event listeners may prevent default processing of the reset request. Otherwise, 
    default handling as described below occurs.</p></li>
  <li><p>A subset or all of the instance data is selected based on the
  binding expression used to invoke the suspend request.
   The selected nodes and all children are selected for resetting.
  If no <code>ref</code> attribute is specified, all nodes in the instance data are selected by default. </p><ol>
    <li><p>If the instance data selection results in an empty node-set, the reset 
      has no effect.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><p>New instance data for the selected instance data is prepared, based on the <code>instance</code> element associated with the current <code>xform</code> element, according to 
    the rules for initialization above.</p></li>
  <li><p>The selected instance data is replaced with the new instance data.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="rpm-serialize"></a>1.6 Serialization Formats for  Instance Data</h3><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-send-urlencoded"></a>1.6.1 application/x-www-form-urlencoded</h4>

<p>This format is intended to facilitate the integration of XForms into HTML forms 
  processing environments, and represents an extension of the <a href="#">[ref-xhtml-1.0]</a>
  form content type of the same name with extensions to expresses the hierarchical
  nature of instance data.</p>
<p>This format is not suitable for the persistence of binary content. Therefore, 
  it is recommended that XForms capable of containing binary content use either 
  the multipart/form-data (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) or text/xml (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>) formats.</p>
<div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="issue-urlencoding-mods"></a><b>Issue (issue-urlencoding-mods):</b></p><p class="prefix"><b>Modifications to urlencoding process</b></p>
<p>The urlencoding technique given here does not exactly match how legacy
  implementations produce urlencoded data. (In particular, we are adding contextual
  information with slashes and multiple location-steps) Will this approach interfere
  with legacy implementations?</p></div>
<div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="issue-utf8-encoding"></a><b>Issue (issue-utf8-encoding):</b></p><p>Under discussion

<p>The steps for building this persistence format is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Prepare a new UTF-8 encoded string buffer to hold the persisted instance
  data.</p></li>
  <li><p>Beginning with the root element of the  instance data, iterate
    over the selected content of the instance data in document order and build an ordered set of
    strings by performing the following steps: 
    
  </p><ol>
      <li><p>For each element with an attribute, append to the set a string of the 
        format "<em>path</em>=<em>value</em>" where
        <em>path</em> is the canonical binding expression that refers to each
        attribute, and <em>value</em> is the character content of each attribute
        (urlencoded if necessary).</p></li>
      <li><p>For each element enclosing character content, append to the set a string 
        of the format "<em>path</em>=<em>value</em>" where <em>path</em> is 
        the canonical binding expression that refers to the element, and
        <em>value</em> is the character content of the element (urlencoded if
        necessary).</p></li>
      <li><p>For each element enclosing element content, continue the iteration.</p></li>
    </ol></li>
  <li><p>Append the strings from the ordered set together, delimiting the strings 
    with an ampersand '&amp;' character, and place the result of the append into 
    the UTF-8 encoded string buffer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="example">
<h5>Example: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</h5>
<table summary="Example" width="100%" bgcolor="#99ffff" border="1" cellpadding="5" class="eg"><tr><td><pre>/PersonName/@title=Mr&amp;/PersonName/FirstName=Roland</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This format consists of sets of a canonical binding expression paired with a value.</p>
<table summary="Example" width="100%" bgcolor="#99ffff" border="1" cellpadding="5" class="eg"><tr><td><pre>&lt;PersonName title="Mr"&gt;
  &lt;FirstName&gt;Roland&lt;/FirstName&gt;

<p>Here is the instance data for the above example.</p>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-send-multipart"></a>1.6.2 multipart/form-data</h4>

<p>This format is intended to facilitate the integration of XForms into HTML forms

  form content type of the same name that expresses the hierarchical 
  nature of instance data. Unlike the application/x-www-form-urlencoded (<a href="#"><b>???</b></a>)

<p>This format follows the rules of all multipart MIME data streams for form data as outlined 
  in <a href="#">[ref-rfc-2388]</a>, with the "name" of each part being the canonical binding expression that references the selected instance data item.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div class="example">
<h5>Example: multipart/form-data</h5>

<table summary="Example" width="100%" bgcolor="#99ffff" border="1" cellpadding="5" class="eg"><tr><td><pre>Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x

--AaB03x
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="/PersonName/@title"

Mr
--AaB03x
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="/PersonName/FirstName"

Roland
--AaB03x

...Possibly more data...

--AaB03x-</pre></td></tr></table>
 <p>This format consists of sets of a canonical binding expression paired 
   with a value.</p>
<table summary="Example" width="100%" bgcolor="#99ffff" border="1" cellpadding="5" class="eg"><tr><td><pre>&lt;PersonName title="Mr"&gt;
  &lt;FirstName&gt;Roland&lt;/FirstName&gt;
&lt;/PersonName&gt;</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Here is the instance data for the above example.</p>
</div>

<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-send-xml"></a>1.6.3 text/xml</h4>
<p>This format permits the expression of the instance data as an XML-based format 
  that is straightforward to process with off-the-shelf XML processing tools. 
  In addition, this format is suitable for the persistence of binary content.</p>
<p>The steps for building this persistence format is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Prepare a new empty XML document to hold the persisted instance data.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the selected content of the instance data corresponds to a singly-rooted data
  structure, serialize, into the XML document the entire content of the selected instance
  data, beginning at the root node.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the selected content of the instance data corresponds to a multiply-rooted data
  structure (such as a general parsed entity), an unqualified root element of &lt;<code>Envelope</code>&gt;,
  with an unqualified element &lt;<code>Body</code>&gt; is inserted into the XML document, and the
  selected instance data serialized into the content of the &lt;<code>Body</code>&gt; element.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="div4">
<h5><a name="rpm-send-xml-binary"></a>1.6.3.1 Binary Content</h5>

<p>Instance data items of the types xsd:base64Binary and xsd:hexBinary are specifically
allowed, and are included in the serialized data according to the rules defined in
<a href="#">[ref-xschema-2]</a></p>
<div class="issue"><p class="prefix"><a name="issue-instance-metadata"></a><b>Issue (issue-instance-metadata):</b></p><p>Where a value 
  within the instance data represents binary content, can we store meta-information
  with an <code>xform:mediaType</code> attribute reflecting the appropriate content
  type (e.g., "image/jpg")?</p></div>

<h3><a name="rpm-conform"></a>1.7 Conformance</h3>
<p>XForms are being designed for use on hardware platforms of all sizes, from tiny handheld devices to high-powered servers. Clearly, a one-size-fits-all approach has its drawbacks. For this reason, the XForms Working Group has begun specifying two conformance levels for XForms Processors, documents, and authoring tools.</p>
<div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-conform-basic"></a>1.7.1 XForms Basic</h4><p>This conformance level will be suitable for devices with limited computing power, such as mobile phones, handheld computers, and appliances. This conformance level will depend on a subset of XML Schema, and will not include any resource-intensive features. Implementations of XForms Basic should return "<code>basic</code>" for the <code>conformance-level</code> property.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="rpm-conform-full"></a>1.7.2 XForms Full</h4><p>


This conformance level will be suitable for more powerful forms processing, such as might be found on a standard desktop browser or a server. Implementations of XForms Full should return "<code>full</code>" for the <code>conformance-level</code> property.</p><p>Additional details will be provided in future revisions of this chapter.</p></div></div>
